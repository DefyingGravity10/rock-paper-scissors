# rock-paper-scissors

<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>This project is a simple implementation of the classical game <em>Rock Paper Scissors</em>. In here, the player is asked to select between rock, paper, or scissors and will be evaluated alongside the "choice" made by the computer. The scores will then be tallied, and the first one to reach five (5) points wins.

The design of this implementation was inspired from classical retro games. Essentially, the layout was made to resemble an old-style console.

Overall, this project was written from scratch using <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>Javascript</code>.</p>
